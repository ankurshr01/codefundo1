It can predict amount of rainfall , and hence can predict flood in a particular city.
It can save million dollars of damage caused by floods(e.g. - kerela floods, etc)
Users(common people of city) can upload the pictures of leaves of a particular tree over a region.The statistical calibration will record and compare the amount of moisture in atmosphere by amount of moisture thrown through TRANSPIRATION over a given period of time and hence can predict the amount of water in near by Dam and other water reservior, and can predict the flood around 2-3 weeks prior. 
In a given region ,say city, people can not only predict floods , they can also save their crops and ofcourse million dollars damage can be avoided.
There will be state level as well as city level and district level authorities that will be mainting the database of uploaded pictures by local peoples from different regions . There will be stats of water storage in dams , major water bodies , municipal sewage system, along with periodic rainwaters and we can use AI to maintain all those stats and to make alert if conditions of flooding due to these parameters are likely to occur.It can also suggest various measures to maintain flood management in a given region , for example - it can suggest for a particular capacity of dam contruction and other enviromental related imrovement to ensure future flood management in a particular region .
